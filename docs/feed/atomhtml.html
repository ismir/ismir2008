<UL><A HREF="../papers/ISMIR2008_261.pdf">On the Use of Sparse Time-Relative Auditory Codes for Music</A><br />

<p>The best student paper award carries a prize of $300.  Congratulations to Pierre-Antione, Thierry, and Douglas!</p>
<p><i>About the ISMIR 2008 Best Student Paper Award:</i><br />
The award was selected by a panel of judges drawn from the conference organizers and program committee.  For consideration, the first author had to be a student at the time the paper was submitted, and the paper had to be presented at the conference by one of the authors (not necessarily the student author). Judging was based on both the paper and the conference presentations.  </p>
